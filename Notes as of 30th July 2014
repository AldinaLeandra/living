Notes on the application:

1. Colour of output percentages and numbers not changing. Constantly red. Easy fix.
2a. Discrete baskets. Cheapest basket involves starch stuff. Best basket is well-balanced.
2b. Food output - I think there should be a link to a food price calculator (as a reference if needed). This can have multiple purposes beyond this app and be expanded beyond the basket I've selected.
	- The calculator would have 2000 calories as the goal.
	- People adjust how much they spend per day on a particular food item.
	- Asks users to save outputs (generating a whole bunch of baskets).
	- Can only save if 2000 calories (or more) are met.
3. Make sub-costs and total cost (minimal need) more prominent. Perhaps within each accordion tab - and larger.
4. Housing costs and output statements - the output statement should be visible in the accordion. These are the violence and sanitation comments.
5. Healthcare costs - checkbox instead of slider? No health coverage, monthly consultancy fee, and health insurance. Health cost would then be this value multiplied by household size.
6. Education costs - adjustable number of kids as it is.


7. Output in terms of sharing needs to be finalized
