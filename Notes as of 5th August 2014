Notes on the application:

2b. Food output - I think there should be a link to a food price calculator (as a reference if needed). This can have multiple purposes beyond this app and be expanded beyond the basket I've selected.
	- The calculator would have 2000 calories as the goal.
	- People adjust how much they spend per day on a particular food item.
	- Asks users to save outputs (generating a whole bunch of baskets).
	- Can only save if 2000 calories (or more) are met.

3. Make sub-costs and total cost (minimal need) more prominent. Perhaps within each accordion tab - and larger. {Petrus}

4. Housing costs and output statements - the output statement should be visible in the accordion. These are the violence and sanitation comments. {Petrus} 

5a. Healthcare costs - radio button instead of slider? No health budget (R0), monthly consultancy fee(R40/person), comprehensive health insurance (R300/person). Health cost would then be this value multiplied by household size. {Petrus}

5b. {NEW} Healthcare comments - output based on checkbox {Osman}

6. {NEW} Education costs for kids - number of kids' slider should have a max value equivalent to the household size and should adjust as the user adjusts the household size.

7. Output in terms of sharing needs to be finalized. {Petrus, Osman, Adi}

8. {NEW} Should we incorporate the food nutrition program - when education is spent on then food costs go down? Additional complication but somewhat interesting.

9. {NEW} Progress bar along with percentage value? {Petrus, Osman}

Food - CPI Apr 2014 data, STATS SA

Transportation - We assume the cost of getting from Khayelitsha to a Cape Town suburb through a very short informal survey as the base. It is true it can take up to two minibus taxi trips to leave home and arrive at work. These trips combined cost between R14-15. Daily this can then be R28-30. Transportation is not cheap in Cape Town (public or private) and this is likely true through South Africa. Of course if the tariff or the number of trips from poorer areas to urban employer centres were lower then the cost would be lower. But it can also be higher depending on the distance. 

Housing - NIDS 2012, UCT. Associations with violence and sanitation taken from this data as well. Where rent was not paid (or reported), the assumption was that the household lived in informal risky settings. We don't want to highlight that as a residential option. 

Health costs - http://www.southafrica.info/services/health/healthfaq.htm Public consultancy fee
			   Affinity Health has quotes starting from R299.
			   Family plans from SelfMed are very very expensive - around R1200/adult/month
			   BestMed not clear what their price is
			   Bonitas is at least R600/month

Education costs - NIDS 2012. Median expenditure were between R100 and R200/month/kid for when education costs were reported. There isn't a clear determination of costs per month for a family sending kids to school. It's likely on transportation, stationery, etc - but there are some definite costs.
				- We limit the slider to R1000 because households are unliekly to be willing to pay more than that for kids. Public schools with fees and private schools can cost at R1000 and be upwards of R8000/month.

Communication/Recreation - Loose sliders regarding a need for R&R, but also for connectivity. These two items shouldn't be ignored.

Other - Buffer costs including for emergencies and procurement of durable goods, transportation of goods (gas cylinders, groceries, etc), implicit and explicit costs of running a household

We have not incorporated the food nutrition program or child support grants in our assessment. We feel our values are still quite conservative.
