Living Wage Kenya
-----------------

Living Wage Kenya calculator lets employers calculate if they are paying their employees a living wage.

The tool was originally created by OpenUp, formerly Code for South Africa, to highlight the low wages earned by domestic workers.

This site was produced in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.
