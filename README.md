Domestic-Workers
================
This project is meant to create a system which takes inputs from users on how much they pay or think they should pay a domestic worker
and tells them more about what that amount means to the lives of a domestic worker's household.
The user upon learning about the meaning of the payment can then adjust the amount they suggested and should be able to, in real time,
see what that implies.

Assumptions can be altered, including the costs for health in a month, education, transport, and the cost for getting 2000 calories
per day per person

There will be some core data in the backend including how they compare to minimum wage as well as information on costs for
per person health, per child education, transportation, rent, and communications.

Deployment
==========

This project is static HTML and Javascript and is served directly from the gh-pages branch on GitHub.
